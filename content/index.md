<div class="welcome">

<div>

I'm currently a **research intern at CERN** and in my **final year** pursuing dual bachelor's degrees in Data Science and Telecommunication Engineering at UC3M.

Since July 2023, I've been diving into distributed and cloud applications as a **research assistant at UC3M**, exploring cutting-edge technologies that shape our digital future.

My primary passion lies in the transformative power of **cloud computing** and its role in driving the next wave of computing advancements. 

Alongside this, I am also interested in open-source, DevOps, ML, software architecture, and personal growth.

## About This Site
Here, I write about my journey, thoughts, projects, and what I have been learning since August 2024. I hope you find something interesting here!

This site is divided into a few sections:
- [Posts](/posts), a selection of my longer-form writing and thoughts
<!-- - [Projects](/projects) - over the years I've built a lot of things -->
<!-- - [Life](/life), where I'm writing about me and my thoughts -->
- [Notes](/notes), where I write about things I'm working on and exploring

## Current & Future Plans
My current focus is on **researching cloud computing and distributed systems**. 

- How can we leverage the power of the cloud to build scalable, reliable, and efficient systems?
- What direction cloud computing is taking and how to get the best of it?
- Can we build a more sustainable and efficient cloud for the new hungry AI?

In the future, I'm planning to continue my studies with a master's degree in Cloud Computing and Big Data and continue my research in the field.
