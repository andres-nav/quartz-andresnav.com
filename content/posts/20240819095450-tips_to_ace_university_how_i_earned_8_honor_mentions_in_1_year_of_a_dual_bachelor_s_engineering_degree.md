Have you ever failed at something and felt like giving up? I have.

The title might lead you to believe I have always been an academic achiever, but that was not the case.

In my first year of university, I struggled and failed two subjects (in the ordinary call) with an average grade of 7/10.

However, the year after, I turned things around and earned 2 Honor Mentions and an average grade of 8.5/10.

The following year, I earned 8 Honor Mentions and an average grade of 9/10.

This transformation was not due to innate intelligence or luck but rather a result of implementing effective strategies and habits that I will share in this article.

## General overview {#general-overview}

I am pursuing a dual degree in Data Science and Telecommunication Engineering at the University Carlos III of Madrid, Spain.

This dual degree is five and a half years and combines technical skills such as networking, circuits, or software development with analytical skills such as data processing, ML algorithms, or statistics.

It is a challenging program that requires a lot of dedication and hard work. However, it is not impossible.

In this article, I will share the strategies and habits I have implemented to excel in university and earn top honors so that you can apply them to your academic journey or life.


## Tips to Ace University {#tips-to-ace-university}


### 1. Surround Yourself with High Achievers {#1-dot-surround-yourself-with-high-achievers}

Have you ever heard the saying, "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with?"

This saying is true.

If you surround yourself with high achievers, you will be motivated to excel and achieve your goals.

If you surround yourself with unmotivated people, your standards will lower.

Surround yourself with high achievers, learn from them, and be motivated to excel and achieve your goals. Always try to raise your standards to achieve bigger things.


### 2. Own Your Mistakes {#2-dot-own-your-mistakes}

It is okay to make mistakes.

Mistakes are part of the learning process and are an opportunity to grow and improve.

However, it is essential to own your mistakes, learn from them, and take responsibility for them.

Instead of blaming others or making excuses, take ownership of your mistakes, learn from them, and use them as an opportunity to grow and improve.

Mistakes are hints of the places where you need to improve.


### 3. Consistency and Discipline {#3-dot-consistency-and-discipline}

If you cannot do something for long periods of time without any external motivation; it will be hard to achieve anything significant.

Consistency and discipline are the keys to achieving your goals and excelling in university.

In my case, I found it best to have a routine to stick to so you can ensure sticking with the most important things.


### 4. Learn and Be Curious {#4-dot-learn-and-be-curious}

One of the best ways to excel in university and life is to be curious and never stop learning.

Always be curious, ask questions, seek answers, and never stop learning.

Try to find hobbies and interests around your field of study.

For example, in my case, I am interested in designing and architecting software systems. So, I have learned about software architecture and design patterns and participated in projects where I learned more about them.


### 5. Focus Time is better than a Lot of Time {#5-dot-focus-time-is-better-than-a-lot-of-time}

One of the mistakes I made was thinking that the more time I spent studying, the better I would perform.

While this is usually the case, I realized that it is not about the quantity of time you spend studying but rather the quality of time.

Instead of studying for long hours, I studied for short periods with high intensity and concentration.


### 6. Have an Idea of the Outcome that you Want {#6-dot-have-an-idea-of-the-outcome-that-you-want}

Do not study without a clear goal or objective. That will make you unfocused and demotivated.

Take 5 minutes before starting anything and clarify what you want to achieve.

For example, before studying for an exam, clarify what you want to achieve, what topics you want to cover, and how you will measure your progress.

You are as good as the data that you measure.


### 7. Participation and Engagement {#7-dot-participation-and-engagement}

Participation and engagement are the keys to learning and retaining information.

At the beginning of university, I was a passive learner, attending classes without actively participating or engaging with the material.

However, I realized active participation and engagement are crucial to learning and retaining information.

Trying to always be present in class, ask questions, participate in discussions, and engage with the material gets you further than just sitting around.

And especially, do the labs and exercises as they are the best way to learn and understand the concepts.


### 8. Understand, Connect, and Implement {#8-dot-understand-connect-and-implement}

Another mistake that I used to make was to memorize information without understanding it.

I realized that understanding concepts and connecting them to real-life examples or other concepts was crucial to retaining information.

This approach has helped me perform better in exams and develop a deeper understanding of the subjects and their practical applications.


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

In conclusion, excelling in university and earning top honors is not achieved by innate intelligence or luck but by implementing effective strategies and habits.

By focusing on quality time, understanding, connecting, and implementing concepts, participating and engaging actively, being consistent and disciplined, owning your mistakes, being curious and never learning, being results-oriented, and surrounding yourself with high achievers, you can excel in university and achieve your goals.

I hope that you find these tips helpful and that you can apply them to your academic journey or life.
