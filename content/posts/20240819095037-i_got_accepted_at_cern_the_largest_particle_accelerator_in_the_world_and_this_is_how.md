Welcome! If you are interested in electronics, computer science, or physics (especially particle physics), you're in for a treat.

Today, I'm excited to share my journey of **getting accepted at CERN**, home to the **largest particle accelerator in the world**.

Let’s dive into what CERN is, a bit about myself, details about the internship I'm in, and some tips for those aspiring to follow a similar path.

## What is CERN? {#what-is-cern}

CERN, short for the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is one of the world's most prestigious scientific research centers.

Located near Geneva, on the Franco-Swiss border, CERN is renowned for its Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator.

The LHC allows physicists to collide particles at nearly the speed of light, enabling them to probe the fundamental forces of nature and uncover the mysteries of the universe.

At CERN, scientists from all over the globe work together to advance our understanding of particle physics.

The research conducted here has led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the Higgs boson in 2012. And continues to push the boundaries of what we know about the universe.

## About the Internship I Am In {#about-the-internship-i-am-in}

I am currently part of the Summer Student Program at CERN, a highly competitive internship for students specializing in applied physics, engineering, and computing.

This program offers the unique opportunity **to work alongside** some of **the brightest minds** in the field and **contribute to cutting-edge research** and development projects.

During my internship, I'm working on a project that involves developing and optimizing data acquisition systems for one of the experiments at the LHC, specifically in a [library for researching gas detectors for the accelerator](https://gitlab.cern.ch/gasteam/olefin/).

This includes designing and writing software for big data analysis and collaborating with scientists and engineers to ensure the systems perform flawlessly.

For now, it has only been two weeks. However, I'm already learning so much and gaining invaluable hands-on experience that will undoubtedly shape my future career.


## Tips for Aspiring CERN Interns {#tips-for-aspiring-cern-interns}

-   **Build a Strong Foundation**: Make sure you have a solid understanding of your field of interest.

-   **Gain Practical Experience**: Engage in hands-on projects, internships, and research opportunities. Practical experience is highly valued.

-   **Network and Collaborate**: Participate in university associations, competitions, and conferences. Networking with like-minded individuals and professionals can open doors and provide valuable insights and opportunities.

-   **Learn to Code**: Honestly, most of the work I found at CERN involves data analysis and software development. Learning programming languages like Python, C++, and Java can give you a significant advantage.

-   **Stay Curious and Keep Learning**: The world we live in is ever-evolving. Stay curious, research, and keep learning about the latest developments in the field.

-   **Be Resilient**: You never fail until you stop trying. Everyone faces setbacks and rejections. Just think that every "no" brings you closer to a "yes".
