```text
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
```

If you fail at delivery, nothing matters.

Customers only care about what you deliver to them, not how hard you tried.

Focus on solving problems the best way possible, not using the next shiny tool.

Delivery can be measured in:

-   Outputs: like stock price, free cashflow, revenue, etc
-   Inputs: the actions you take

It is best to focus on [inputs]({{< relref "20240928132819-inputs_vs_outputs.md" >}}), because they are the things you can control.

There is so much work in the delivery, it is not the finish line, it is the starting line.
The best teams are fast and organized about launching, but **constantly iterating**.
