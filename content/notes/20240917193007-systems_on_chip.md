Integrated circuits that combine multiple components into a single chip. Usually there is a Processor System (PS) and a Programmable Logic (PL).

Processor System (PS), like a CPU, has the memory, peripherals (e.g., GbEthernet, I2C, SPI, GPIO, etc.), and interfaces (e.g., PCIe, USB, etc.).
It is used to run software which can be "bare-metal" or an operating system (e.g., Linux).

Programmable Logic (PL), like an FPGA, is composed of logic cells, memory blocks, and I/O links (e.g., Milti-GigaBit Transceivers).
It is used to implement real-time data logic, interfaces to other processing PLs, or more peripherals.

This combination provides large flexibility, and allows one to integrate the electronics modules directly into the control network of an experiment.

High energy physics use cases

-   Interactive tools
-   Integration with Detector Control Systems for hardware control
-   Integration with Run Control Systems for operation control
-   Trigger processing
-   Readout of physics data
-   Physics-oriented calibration and monitoring tasks
-   Etc.

Problems to solve

-   How to organize networks with many, O(1000), nodes?
    Network switches, IP numbering, boot services, etc.
-   How to provide network security?
-   Can common software solutions (e.g., operating systems, drivers, libraries, tools) be used?


## Electronic Systems {#electronic-systems}

In slide 8 of this [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/799275/contributions/3413721/attachments/1860452/3057392/Spiwoks_SoCWS_INTRO_20190612.pdf), to control the electronics several methods are explained.

VME was a popular standard in the past, where a Signle-Board Computer (SBC) was used to control the electronics. The SBC was connected to the VME bus, and the electronics modules were connected to the VME bus. The SBC was running the control software.

Currently, the most popular standard is the ATCA standard. The ATCA standard is a high-speed serial standard, where the electronics modules are connected to the ATCA backplane. The ATCA backplane is connected to the ATCA shelf manager, which is running the control software.

However, a new control standard is needed. Is MicroTCA.4 standard the answer?
