Computing execution model where cloud providers allocate machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers.

This model works under [4 tenets](https://github.com/serverless/guide/blob/master/source/README.md#what-is-serverless):

1.  **Zero administration**: users are only responsible on writing the code and cloud providers manage the resources for security, scalability, etc.
2.  **Pay-per-execution**: users only pay for the resources they consume.
3.  **Function as unit of deployment**: serverless architectures are composed of small, independent bits of code (functions) that are loosely coupled and collaborative, usually used in the [microservice]({{< relref "20240821105431-microservices.md" >}}) architecture.
4.  **Event-driven**: events start serverless functions and provide them with the data/context needed.

They have some limitations:

-   **Stateless**: they do not keep hold any information from subsequent runs.
-   **Time limitations**: depending on the cloud providers different maximum execution times are allowed (e.g., AWS Lambda has a 15 min maximum execution time).
