```text
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
```

Leaders usually navigate through ambiguity, and leaders must be able to sift through the noise, find the signal, and **what really matters for customers**.

**Find the best possible answer for customers, whoever's idea it is.**

<span class="underline">Leaders speak last in the room, as leaders want everybody's input</span>.

When thinking about a hard issue, we need to get:

-   The right people that know the issue
-   The right people to get feedback
-   Listen to the different perspectives
-   Think about **what is the best possible answer for customers and for the business**

Leaders question their closely held beliefs and think:

-   Are they really right?
-   Is there another way to think about it?
-   Can we do better for customers?

Remember, .
