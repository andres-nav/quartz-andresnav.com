Decision can be boiled down to One-way door or Two-way door decision.

Attention: sometimes, it is not black and white, but a spectrum.


## Two-way door {#two-way-door}

Decisions that can be reversed and there is little to no harm if the decision is wrong.

They are the majority of the decisions.

They should be done in the team level and quickly.

For example, a new feature that can be rolled back if it is not successful, a new process that can be reverted if it is not working, etc.


## One-way door {#one-way-door}

These are the decisions that are hard to reverse and have a significant impact.

They should be done in the leadership level and slowly.

For example, where you are going to live, who you are going to marry, what you are going to do for a living, etc.
