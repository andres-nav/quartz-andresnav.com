Networking computing architecture based on long-running interconnected hosts that execute a collection of application processes that communicate via the network.
Processes can be reached using various addresses and names, predominantly based on IP addresses, hostnames, and L4 port numbers.

This term was first discovered while reading the paper [Boxer: FaaSt Ephemeral Elasticity for Off-the-Shelf Cloud Applications]({{< relref "boxer_faast_emphemeral_elasticity.md" >}}).
