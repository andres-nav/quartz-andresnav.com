> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

A team is comprised of great people who are:

-   smart
-   are right, a lot
-   inventive
-   look around corners
-   think big
-   look into the details
-   able to move quickly
-   have high ownership
-   and specially have the right customer obsession

As managers, leaders must be organized and thoughtful about what a person does well and what they need to grow.

Leaders must be good as coaching, it is a privilege to be a manager. That is they must be able to:

-   recognize what a person is good at
-   identify where the person needs to grow
