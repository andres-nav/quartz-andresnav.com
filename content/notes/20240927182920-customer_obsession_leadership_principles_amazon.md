```text
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customers trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
```

-   Put the customer at the center of everything you do.
-   Start with the customer and work backwards.

Tip: for every new product, feature, or service, write a [working backwards document]({{< relref "20240928123603-working_backwards_document.md" >}}).

It also encompasses:

-   Economics of the product is being build. It must be sustainable in the long run
-   Competitors: see what competitor are offering and if there is something that customers really like. If the competitor builds something customer really like, we should be aware of it, be inspired by it, and think about how we can improve our own customer experience with what we learned from what competitors have done.
