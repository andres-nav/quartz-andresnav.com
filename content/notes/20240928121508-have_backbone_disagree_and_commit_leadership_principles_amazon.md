> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Leaders are expected to speak up if something is done that is badly affecting customers and businesses, regardless of level.

"I told you so" is the most useless expression in existence. It means either:

-   I did not speak up when I was supposed to speak up.
-   I am not fully committed to the decision made.

For every final decision, everyone must commit to it. Even if you did not disagree at the beginning.

The idea is to **be truth-seeking**. The goal is to get to the truth for what [matters to customers]({{< relref "20240927182920-customer_obsession_leadership_principles_amazon.md" >}}).

Once a decision is made, even if you did not disagree at the beginning; everyone must commit to it.

To disagree, first you need to understand the other person's perspective and why they think that way.
Otherwise, you are just arguing.
