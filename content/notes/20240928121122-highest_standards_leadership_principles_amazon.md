```text
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

It means that you don't settle for anything less than what you desire.

It doesn't mean that you are a perfectionist, but it means that you are always looking for ways to improve and grow.

Perfectionism is a fear of failure, but high standards are a desire for excellence. Leaders must be willing to take risks and make mistakes in order to achieve their goals.
