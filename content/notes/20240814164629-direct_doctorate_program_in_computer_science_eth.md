Goal: Educate students to become researchers and future leaders in Computer Science.
Duration: 5 to 6 years.
Study: [M.S. in Computer Science]({{< relref "20240819153635-m_s_in_computer_science_eth.md" >}})
Research: [Ph.D.]({{< relref "20240820050036-ph_d_career_path.md" >}})


## Requirements {#requirements}

Same as the [M.S. in Computer Science]({{< relref "20240819153635-m_s_in_computer_science_eth.md" >}}) but the motivation letter must be different.


### Motivation Letter {#motivation-letter}

-   Explain concisely the motivation and suitability to do doctoral studies in computer science in ETH.
-   Describe any past research, and teaching experience, identify general areas of research.
-   Reflect on two preferred research groups’ work you are interested in to complete the doctoral program. What are their main areas of study and what papers support that case?
-   Future career plans.

Check out [tips to write a Motivation Letter]({{< relref "20240822043722-writing_a_motivation_letter.md" >}}).
Also it would be beneficial to mention the possibility to join the [Deep-Tech Incubation Program]({{< relref "20240822051241-deep_tech_incubation_program_ethz.md" >}}).

Other questions the letter must answer:

-   Why did you choose that research field?
-   Why did you choose Computer Science at ETHz?
-   What makes you a student that the ETHz wants?
-   After explaining your past choices, why ETHz is the logical step for you?
