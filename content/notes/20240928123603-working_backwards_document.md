Before starting to develop a new product, it is important to write a press release and FAQ because:

-   Clear vision and understanding of the project's goals and desired outcomes.
-   Think from the [customer's perspective]({{< relref "20240927182920-customer_obsession_leadership_principles_amazon.md" >}}), focusing on the benefits and value that the product will deliver to users.
-   Make [informed decisions]({{< relref "20240928121218-bias_for_action_leadership_principles_amazon.md" >}}) throughout the development process
-   Encourages teams to [think creatively]({{< relref "20240928055839-think_big_leadership_principles_amazon.md" >}}) about how to achieve their goals, leading to innovative solutions and product features.
