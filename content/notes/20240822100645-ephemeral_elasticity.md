It refers to a new type of computing [elasticity]({{< relref "20240821111823-elasticity.md" >}}) proposed in the [Boxer: FaaSt Ephemeral Elasticity for Off-the-Shelf Cloud Applications]({{< relref "boxer_faast_emphemeral_elasticity.md" >}}) paper.

Ephemeral elasticity is running applications across both VM/containers as well as FaaS with the goal of having a single orchestrated application deployment that takes advantage of both types of infrastructure.

Thus, ephemeral elasticity is proposed for affordable and highly elastic cloud infrastructures.
