\\(Outputs = Inputs \* Leverage\\)

-   Inputs are the work you put in
-   Outputs are the results
-   Leverage is the multiplier between the two

Inputs are capped by time, energy, and resources. Leverage is uncapped. The more leverage you have, the more outputs you can get from the same inputs.

Leverage can come from:

-   Technology
-   People
-   Attention
-   Capital
