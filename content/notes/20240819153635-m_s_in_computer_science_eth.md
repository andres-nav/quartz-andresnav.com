## FAQ {#faq}


### My official transcript of records already confirms the language of instruction/examination of my Bachelor's degree programme. Do I need to submit a separate confirmation letter? {#my-official-transcript-of-records-already-confirms-the-language-of-instruction-examination-of-my-bachelor-s-degree-programme-dot-do-i-need-to-submit-a-separate-confirmation-letter}

No. If the language of instruction is confirmed on one of the following documents: transcript of records, enrolment confirmation or (if you have already graduated) in your Diploma Supplement, you can use that same document as proof/confirmation in your application. You will simply have to upload it twice in eApply (once in the section “Academic history” and once in “Languages”).


### I earned a double major/double degree at the same institution. Do I list the institution only once in the Master's online application form? {#i-earned-a-double-major-double-degree-at-the-same-institution-dot-do-i-list-the-institution-only-once-in-the-master-s-online-application-form}

If both majors are attached to a single degree (double major), list the institution once and include both majors separated by a comma.

If you earned two separate degrees (double degree), list the institution twice and enter one degree for each entry.


### My institution does not report GPAs on a 4.0 or ECTS grading scale. How should I report my GPA in the online Master application? {#my-institution-does-not-report-gpas-on-a-4-dot-0-or-ects-grading-scale-dot-how-should-i-report-my-gpa-in-the-online-master-application}

Please enter "0.00" for the GPA, and use the "Unconverted GPA" and "Unconverted GPA System" fields instead.

Do NOT convert your GPA or any other grades to a 4-​point scale or ECTS grading scale.

E.g. students from India: Most universities/colleges in India either use a 10 point scale known as the CGPA (Cumulative GPA), or just plain percentages. Please do not convert your Marks/Percentage to a GPA scale, indicate the scale that is used by your institute.

We are familiar with different types of grading systems.


### What transcript do I need to submit with my application? {#what-transcript-do-i-need-to-submit-with-my-application}

Transcripts from all universities attended – with no exceptions – must be submitted. Transcripts must be included from interrupted or non-​completed degree programmes, changes of degree programme or university and exchange studies. Academic programmes in disciplines not relevant to the application must also be fully documented with transcripts.

If no examinations were undertaken in a degree programme and/or no transcript was issued, an official confirmation from the university is required in place of a transcript.

All academic levels (Bachelor’s, Master’s, doctorate etc.) must be documented.

Academic achievements or credits must always be confirmed by the university where they were actually acquired. For mobility and exchange programmes, a transcript from the host university is required; mobility or exchange credits recognised on the transcript of the home university are not sufficient.

If study achievements or credits were obtained in joint-​degree or double-​degree programmes a transcript from each participating university, with a description of the programme, is required.
