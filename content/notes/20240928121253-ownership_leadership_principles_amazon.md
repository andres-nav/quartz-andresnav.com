```text
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job".
```

-   Feel like owners
-   Think about problems holistically
-   Find the right owner to resolve the issue

Owners ensure that problems are owned, that they have a path to resolution and they drive it themselves as needed.
They think about the long-term impact of their decisions and actions.
